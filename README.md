[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

Library to parse dependency lock files from the Ruby ecosystem.

Bundler's `Gemfile.lock` is the most common, but there's also `gems.deps.rb.lock` for use with Rubygems directly.
